# Lending and Borrowing

Lenders / Depositors - provide funds to borrowers in return for interest on their deposit
Borrowers / Loan Takers - willing to pay interest on the amount the borrowed in exchange for having a lump sum of money available immediately

## DeFi Lending

Allows users to become lenders or borrowers in completely decentralized and permissionless way while maintaining full custody over their coins.

DeFi Lending is based on smart contracts that run on open blockchain, predominantly `Ethereum`. This is why DeFi lending in contrast to CeFi lending is accessible to everyone without the need of providing your personal details or trusting someone else to hold your funds.

## Biggest DeFi lending Markets - Compound, AAVE

They work by creating a money market for particular tokens such as `ETH` stable coins like `DAI` and `USDC` or other tokens like `Link` or `WBTC`.

Users who what to become lenders supply their tokens to the particular money market and start receiving tokens according to their current `supply APY`. The supply tokens are sent to a smart contract and become available for other users to borrow. In exchange for supply tokens, the smart contract issues other tokens that reperesent the supply tokens + interests. This tokens are called `C-tokens` in `Compound` and `A-tokens` in `AAVE`. They can be redeem for the underlying tokens.

All of the loans are over-collateralized. This means that the user who wants to borrow funds has to supply tokens in the form of collateral that is worth more than the actual loan that they want to take.

### Is there a limit on the amount that can be borrowed?

- Yes
  The amount that can be borrowed depens on two main factors.

1. How much funds are available to be borrowed in a perticular market?
2. What is the collateral factor of supply tokens?

Collateral Factors - determines how much can be borrowed based on the quality of the collateral.

The value of the borrowed amount must always stay lower than the value of their collateral times it's collateral factor

#### Invariant

`a` - value of borrowed amount

`b` - value of collateral

`c` - collateral factor

`a < b * c`

There is no limit on how long a user can borrow funds for.

### Liquidation

If the value of the collateral falls below the required collateral level, the user would have their collateral liquidated in order for the protocol to repay the borrowed amount.

### Interest

The interest that the lenders receive and the interest that borrowers have to pay are determined by the ratio between supplied and borrowed tokens in a particular market.

The interest that is paid by borrowers is the interest earned by lenders. So the borrowers `APY` is higher than the supply `APY` in a particular market.

### APY

The interest APYs are calcualted per ethereum block. Calculating APYs per block means that DeFi lending provides variable interest rates that can change quite dramatically, depending on the landing and borrowing demand for particular tokens.

### Mechanics of Compound

#### Example:

A user deposits 10 ETH into Compound. In exchange for 10 ETH, Compound issues `C-tokens`. In this case `C-ETH`.

How many `C-ETH` will the user receive?

Depends on the current exchange rate for a particular market. In this case `ETH`.

When a new market is created the exchange rate between `C-tokens` and `Underlying-tokens` is set to `0.02`.
This rate can only increase with each ethereum block.

If the user supplys 10 ETH, when the market was just created they would have received - 10 / 0.02 = 500.

Because the ether market has been operation for a while, we can assume that the exchange rate is already higher. Let's say it's 0.021. That means that the user would receive around `476.19 C-ETH` if the user decided to immediately redeem their ETH. They should receiver roughly the same amount as it was deposited, which is around 10 ETH. - `476.19 * 0.021 = ~10 ETH`

#### Where the magic happens!?

The user holds their `C-ETH` (another ERC20 tokens, that can be send anywhere). The main difference is that `C-ETH` is necessary to redeem the underlying `ETH` from Compound. On top of that `C-ETH` keep accumulating interest, even if it's sent from the original wallet that initiated the deposit to another wallet.

With each ethereum block the exhange rate would increase. The rate of the increase depends on the supply APY, which is determined by the ratio of supplied borrowed capital.

In our example, let's say that the exchange rate from `C-ETH` to `ETH` increased by `0.0000000002` with each block. Assuming that the rate of increase stays the same for a month, we can easily calculate the interest that can be made during that time. Let's say on avarage we have 4 block per minute. This gives us the following number: `0.0000000002 * 4 * 60 * 24 * 30 = 0.00003456`. Now we can add this number to the previous exchange rate - `0.00003456 + 0.021 = 0.02103456`. This number is slightly higher than the previous exchange rate.

If the user decides to redeem their eth they would receive around `476.19 * 0.02103456 = ~10.0165 ETH`. So the user just made `0.0165` ETH in a month. Which is around `0.16 %` return on their ETH.

#### !!! The original amount of `C-ETH` that the user received hasn't changed at all, and only the change in the exchange rate allowed the user to redeem more `ETH` than was initially deposited

### Mechanics of AAVE

AAVE uses a similar model with interest being accumulated every single block.

The main difference is that `A-tokens` value is pegged to the value of the underlying tokens at 1:1 ratio. The interest is distributed to `A-token` holders directly, by continously increasing their wallet balance. `A-token` holders can also decide ot redirect their stream of interest payments to another ethereum address.

### Borrowing

When it comes to borrowing users lock their `C-tokens` or `A-tokens` as collateral and borrow other tokens. Collateral earn interest but users cannot redeem or transfer assets while they are being used as collateral.

The amount that can be borrowed is determined by the collateral factor of the supplied assets.

There is a smart contract that looks at all the collateral across users account and calculates how much can be safely borrowed without getting liquidated immediately.

To determine the value of collateral `Compound` uses it's own price feed, that takes prices from several highly liquid exchanges.

`AAVE` relies on ChainLink and falls back to their own price feed in necessary.

If a user decides to repay the borrowed amount and unlock their collateral they also have to repay the accured interest on their borrowed assets.

The amount of accured interest is determined by the `borrow APY` and is also increased automatically each ethereum block.
